= Geometric duality honors presentation =

" Geometric duality is a correspondence between certain types of geometric objects, where the properties of one object are transformed into the properties of another 
object. For example, in projective geometry, the points and lines in a projective space are dual to each other, in the sense that the properties of a point and the 
properties of a line that are dual to each other are transformed into each other under a projective transformation. In topology, Poincar√© duality is a relationship 
between homology and cohomology groups of a space. In algebraic geometry, the notion of a variety is self-dual in the sense that the variety and its dual variety have
the same underlying set, but different topologies and different algebraic structures. "
