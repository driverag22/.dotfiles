== Types of exercises ==
1.  (learn formulas like second derivative test)

    - [X] Might be with polar coordinates - 6
- [X] Polar coords: _r_(t) = (r(t), O), _r_'(t) = (r'(t), r(t) 0'(t))
 
3.  (double check theory)
- [X] Show that vector field is conservative <=> has scalar potential and then find it (contractible and curl F = 0) - 9
    - [X] Scalar potential of F is phi : F = grad phi
- [X] Show that vector field is source free <=> has vector potential and then find it (hypothesis H and div F = 0) - 9

5.  (try examples)
- [X] Stokes theorem, i.e., parametrize line or use path independence to solve integral - 9
    - [X] Use curl = 0 (on R³ or on V)
    - [X] Use parametrization of path
    - [X] Find \phi : G = grad \phi, and then the integral = \phi(end point) - \phi(start point)
    - [X] Find simple G : F |_S = G, and find the vector potential for that.
    - [X] Can also use two/three/... different paths
 
6.  (go over homework exercises)
