= Singleton Design Pattern =
The singleton design pattern is a design pattern in which a class can only have one instance at any given time, and it provides a global point of access to that 
instance. This is useful for cases where only a single instance of a class should control the action throughout the execution.


You create a single instance of that class which you always pass. In particular, it looks like this:

{{{java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
}}}
