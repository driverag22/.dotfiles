= The Scaffholding Process =

=== Step 1 - Building your scaffholding ===
_Adapting_ your interventions to your students through:
  - Diagnosis (what does your student already know and what is the problem?)
  - Checking your interpretation/diagnosis
  - Intervention through questions, feedback, clues, worked examples and (short) instruction.
  - Checking for understanding.

Building scaffholding also helps build your relationship with your students.


=== Step 2 - Dismantling your scaffholding ===
Slowly _reduce_ the intensity of your guidance.
  - Reduction is based on continuous diagnosis and checking of your diagnosis.

Reducing guidance at the right place helps students build up _competency and confidence_ increasing motivation.


=== Step 3 - Let students stand on their own ===
Give students more responsibility and ownership of their own learning.

Allowing students to stand on their own gives them _autonomy_ and a lot of _satisfaction_, both of which have a very positive impact on motivation.
