= ADTs =
An abstract data type makes available, for use in programs, a set of abstract values together with operations on those values. 
Its implementation is encapsulated and not directly accessible by client code, so that client code does not depend on the implementation.

ADTs are usefull because they provide a way to specify the behaviour of a data type without specifying its implementation details (separation of concerns). 
 - [ ] Implementation code can change without affecting correctness of client code, limiting the consequences of making changes to implementations.
 - [ ] Facilitates multiple implementations of the same ADT.


For ADTs we differentiate between:
 - [ ] *Specification*: contracts for indiv. operations and zero or more public invariants
 - [ ] *Implementation*: represenation invariant and abstraction function

In terms of *code* and *implementation*, what is needed to implement an ADT is:
 - [ ] *Code*: a data represenation (in terms of concrete types or other ADTs) and implementation of all operations.
 - [ ] *Documentation*: represenation invariant (conditions under which data rep. is valid), and abstraction function (mapping valid data represenation to the 
       corresponding abstract value).
