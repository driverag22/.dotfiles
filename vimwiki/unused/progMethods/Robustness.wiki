= Robustness =
-> The ability of software to handle unexpected input, edge cases, and environmental changes without crashing or producing incorrect results.

=== Advantages (of Java Exceptions > Special Value) ===
 1. If all return values can occur under normal circumstances, it would be impossible to return a special value.
 2. Client code needs to handle the checking for the special value, even if they just want to propagate the signal to a higher level.
 3. The programmer might forget to check the special return value, while exceptions cannot be ignored so easily.
 4. Exceptions can carry additional information.

=== Disadvantages (of robustness) ===
 1. Overhead to write the precondition checks and to test them.
 2. Overhead to read and understand during maintenance/evolution of the code.
 3. Runtime overhead in checking the precondition, even if satisfied.
 4. Runtime overhead in throwing, propagating and catching the exceptions.
