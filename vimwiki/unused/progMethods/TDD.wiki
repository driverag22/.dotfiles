=== Benefits of implementing test cases _before_ software ===

  1. It helps *stabilize interface and contracts* _before_ implementing them. 
  2. It *encourages analysis of interfaces and contracts* _before_ implementing them.
  3. It allows you to *focus on implementing the module and getting it to work* without being interupted by test case development.
