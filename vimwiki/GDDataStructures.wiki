In computational geometry problems, geometric duality could be used to design efficient data structures to solve geometric problems.

For example, in range searching problems, the duality between points and lines can be used to design efficient data structures such as kd-trees and range trees. 
These data structures allow us to solve geometric problems in a more efficient way than traditional methods.
