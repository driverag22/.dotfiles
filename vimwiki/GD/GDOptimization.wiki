Geometric duality can be used to reformulate an optimization problem in such a way that it becomes easier to solve. For example, linear programming problems can be 
transformed into geometric problems and solved using techniques from projective geometry.

The simplex algorithm for linear programming, which is a widely used method for solving linear programming problems, is based on the duality between linear programs 
and their dual programs. By reformulating the problem in its dual form, we can find an efficient solution to the problem.
