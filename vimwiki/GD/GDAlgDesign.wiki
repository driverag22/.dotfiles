Geometric duality can be used to design new algorithms for solving problems in competitive programming. For example, the simplex algorithm for linear programming is
based on the duality between linear programs and their dual programs.

By understanding the duality between different types of geometric objects, we can design new algorithms for solving problems in competitive programming. 
 
For example, the visibility graph of a set of obstacles in the plane is a graph whose vertices correspond to the obstacles and whose edges correspond to pairs of 
obstacles that can see each other. The problem of computing visibility graphs can be solved using the duality between points and lines in projective geometry. 
By designing an algorithm that takes advantage of this duality, we can find an efficient solution to the problem.
