# Patches and modifications 

This is the, possibly incomplete, list of patches of my dwm.

- fullgaps
- barpadding
- activeindicatorbar (slightly modified)
- focusfullscreen
- barheight
- restartsig

In addition, the _colorscheme_ has been manually modified, and the possibility to move to _left_ and _right_ tag (and to move client to left and right tag) have 
been added.

Other patches/changes might be present as well but (currently) not accounted for.
