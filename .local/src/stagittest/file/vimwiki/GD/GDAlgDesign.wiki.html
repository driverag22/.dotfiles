<a href="#l1" class="line" id="l1">      1</a> Geometric duality can be used to design new algorithms for solving problems in competitive programming. For example, the simplex algorithm for linear programming is
<a href="#l2" class="line" id="l2">      2</a> based on the duality between linear programs and their dual programs.
<a href="#l3" class="line" id="l3">      3</a> 
<a href="#l4" class="line" id="l4">      4</a> By understanding the duality between different types of geometric objects, we can design new algorithms for solving problems in competitive programming. 
<a href="#l5" class="line" id="l5">      5</a>  
<a href="#l6" class="line" id="l6">      6</a> For example, the visibility graph of a set of obstacles in the plane is a graph whose vertices correspond to the obstacles and whose edges correspond to pairs of 
<a href="#l7" class="line" id="l7">      7</a> obstacles that can see each other. The problem of computing visibility graphs can be solved using the duality between points and lines in projective geometry. 
<a href="#l8" class="line" id="l8">      8</a> By designing an algorithm that takes advantage of this duality, we can find an efficient solution to the problem.
